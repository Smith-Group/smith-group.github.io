# deeppicker R Package

`deeppicker` provides an R interface to the DEEP Picker tools for
automated peak picking in one- and two-dimensional NMR spectra. The
package wraps the DEEP Picker engines, exposes file readers for
supported spectrum formats, and returns picked peaks and confidence
scores in R-friendly objects.

The underlying DEEP Picker code and algorithms were created by Da-Wei Li
and Rafael Bruschweiler. The R package interface was created by Colin
Smith.

## Package scope

This package is focused on bringing DEEP Picker into R with:

- wrappers for 1D and 2D peak picking
- readers for supported spectrum formats
- outputs designed for direct use in R workflows
